# Setup Instructions for Car Color Detection System

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Download YOLO Model Files

You need to download the following files:

1. **YOLOv3 Weights** (237 MB)
   - Download from: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
   - Or use: `wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights`

2. **YOLOv3 Configuration**
   - Download from: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg
   - Or create it manually (see yolov3.cfg in this directory)

3. **COCO Class Names**
   - Download from: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names
   - Or create it manually (see coco.names in this directory)

## Step 3: Organize Files

Create a folder structure like this:

```
car_color_detection/
├── main_app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── setup_instructions.txt
├── model_files/
│   ├── yolov3.weights
│   ├── yolov3.cfg
│   └── coco.names
└── sample_images/
    └── (your test images)
```

## Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
python main_app.py
```

## How to Use the Application

1. **Load Model**: Click "Load YOLO Model" and select:
   - First: yolov3.cfg file
   - Second: yolov3.weights file
   - Third: coco.names file

2. **Select Image**: Click "Select Image" and choose an image with cars

3. **Detect Cars**: Click "Detect Cars" to perform detection

4. **Save Result**: Click "Save Result" to save the output image

## Expected Output

- Blue cars will have RED bounding boxes
- Other colored cars will have BLUE bounding boxes
- People will have GREEN bounding boxes
- Summary will show: Total cars, Blue cars, Other cars, and People count

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error:
- Make sure all model files are downloaded correctly
- Check that OpenCV is installed properly
- Verify image file paths are correct
- Ensure you have enough RAM (at least 2GB free)
